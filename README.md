# Web Vulnerability Scanner – JScanSec Project

This module is part of the collective project “JScanSec” – a Java-based security scanner built by a team of three students. The Web Vulnerability Scanner is responsible for scanning a target website for basic security misconfigurations such as exposed files, insecure HTTP headers, and risky HTTP methods. It is designed to provide beginner-friendly results that are easy to understand even for users without a background in cybersecurity.

This is Module 2 of the JScanSec project.
